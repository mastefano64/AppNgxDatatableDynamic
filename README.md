# Angular ngx datatable

ngx-datatable is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data. It has all the  features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with no external dependencies. The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about  your data or how you: filter, sort or page it. It also support "row detail" and "row grouping".
