# Angular ngx datatable

ngx-datatable is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data. It has all the
features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with no external dependencies.
The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about
your data or how you: filter, sort or page it. It also support "row detail" and "row grouping".

Through the "Configure" button it is possible to establish the fields that must be present in 
the table and in detail and varying the order. It is also possible to insert a custom component
in detail (this is present in example 5 - I'am a dynamic component - DetailExtraComponent).

In the project there is also a datasource for client and server paging.
