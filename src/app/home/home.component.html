    ngx-datatable is an Angular component for presenting large and complex data. It has all the
    features you would expect from any other table but in a light package with no external dependencies.
    The table was designed to be extremely flexible and light; it doesn't make any assumptions about
    your data or how you: filter, sort or page it. It also support "row detail" and "row grouping".
  </p>

  <p class="home-box1">
    1) Through the "Configure" button it is possible to establish the fields that must be present in the
    table and in detail. In addition to varying the order. 2) It is also possible to insert a custom component
    in detail (this is present in example 5 - I'am a dynamic component - DetailExtraComponent).
  </p>

  <p class="home-box2">
    In this demo you can find 5 examples: "filter, sort and  page", "row grouping", "row detail", "and more".<br><br>
